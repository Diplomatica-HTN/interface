                <p className="articletext">McKenzie told reporters that the strike, which he said killed seven children, was a "mistake" and offered an apology. The investigation released Friday found that all of those killed in the residential compound were civilians. The military-based the strike on a reasonable certainty standard to launch the strike on the vehicle. Tragically, it was the wrong vehicle, a US military official familiar with the investigation told CNN earlier Friday, adding that reasonable certainty is not 100% certainty. Previously, US Central Command pointed to "significant secondary explosions" as evidence of a "substantial amount of explosive material" in the vehicle.
