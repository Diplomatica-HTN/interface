              Articles are long, politics are boring, social issues are too large to handle and ranting to friends leads to nowhereâ€“and if you are able to find solutions, theyâ€™re all on different applications. <br/><br/>In our global politics class, we had a discussion about the Federal Election and the rise in propaganda in a digital-first world. So, for our hack, we wanted to clear the mist by alleviating false and opinionated facts through a gamified system. Introducing, Diplomatica.<br/><br/>

              <h5 className="manifesto linkheader">The Platform</h5><br/>We are building a world of political scientists by gamifying political and social awareness. At the moment, itâ€™s virtually impossible to find out whatâ€™s right and whatâ€™s wrong about a certain event, such as currently, Afghanistanâ€™s events. But thatâ€™s what Diplomatica is for, bringing the truth to everyone. <br/><br/>

The platform is broken down into three parts. Scraping relevant and desired articles, summarizing them with our AI models, and a decentralized debate platform to spark thought-provoking conversations and to compete with your friends using our points system.
