                <p className="articletext">Ontario officials have released more guidance on the implementation of the province's proof-of-vaccination system, which comes into effect on Sept. 22. The vaccine certificate system will cover "higher-risk" indoor spaces where masks can't be worn at all times, officials say. The province has amended its list to apply to the following settings: Restaurants and Bars, Nightclubs, Banquet Halls, Sporting Events, Casinos, Concerts. Ontario also reported 577 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday and seven more deaths. Of the new cases, 452 are among individuals who have either not been fully vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.
